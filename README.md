# Hi There 👋

I really like to develop using flutter. I've been watching Flutter since
beta version and start using it professionally since 1.0. Like to follow new tech
and learn new stuff. Right now working at [PT Global Investa Capital](https://globalinvestacapital.com/)
as Senior mobile dev. Outside work I really like japanese music and playing games.
